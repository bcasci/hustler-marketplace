# Testing Guide

This skill provides testing guidance for Rails applications using RSpec.

## Quick Reference
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test behavior, not implementation

<aaa_pattern>
## Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern

Structure tests in three clear phases:
- Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
- Act: Execute the code being tested
- Assert: Verify the results

Example: [concrete example here]
</aaa_pattern>
