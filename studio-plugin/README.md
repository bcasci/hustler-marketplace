# Hustler Studio

**Status:** Coming soon

## What This Is

Development workflows for shipping quality software without over-engineering.

## Philosophy

**Lean and pragmatic.** Disciplined workflows that work.

- **Project agnostic** - Works in greenfield or existing projects. Adapts to your conventions.
- **LLM orchestrates, tools execute** - Let AI make decisions, bash does simple ops
- **Transparent** - Everything visible, nothing opaque
- **Test-first** - TDD discipline baked in
- **Self-healing** - Workflows loop until passing or truly stuck
- **Gets things done** - From planning to shipping

Workflows look to project memory (CLAUDE.md, rules, patterns) for conventions and standards. They adapt to what they find rather than imposing opinions.

## What's Coming

- TDD workflows (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Safe refactoring with test coverage
- Planning and spec generation
- Quality gates and validation
- GitHub integration

## Design Principles

**KISS** - Keep it simple. Focused workflows that solve real problems.

**YAGNI** - You aren't gonna need it. Build what's useful.

**Pragmatic** - Solve real problems. Ship quality code.
